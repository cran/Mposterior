Mposterior: R package for Robust and Scalable Bayes via a Median of Subset Posterior Measures

Mposterior package facilitates easy estimation of a median of subset posterior measures called M-posterior. We assume that the user already has samples from the subset posterior measures. 

For theoretical details and practical motivation for M-posterior, please see Minsker et al. 2014.
