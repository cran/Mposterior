Title: Mposterior: R package for Robust and Scalable Bayes via a Median
        of Subset Posterior Measures

Description: Mposterior package provides a general framework for estimating a
    median of subset posterior measures (M-posterior). Each subset posterior measure
    is represented as a matrix of posterior samples; rows represent the atoms and 
    columns index the dimensions. All subset measures are represented as list of 
    matrices; length of the list equals the number of subsets (or machines). The        
    distance between subset posterior measures and M-posterior is measured using the RBF kernel.
    M-posterior is represented as a weighted combination of empirical measures based on 
    subsets measures. These weights are estimated using Weiszfeld algorithm implemented
    in this package.
